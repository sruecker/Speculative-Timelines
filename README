The different version of Speculative-Timeline are in 3 folders:

'z_scrolling' folder version has text as boxes that scroll into the depth of the screen

'topdown' folder version is arranged close to a traditional calender. Its graphics currently look too much like a video game

'unity' is the Unity version. The current code in the repository builds off a 'basic' unity framework with XML reading, etc that hasn't been uploaded yet
